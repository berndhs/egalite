== Build and Install ==

To build Egalite, you must first install QXmpp.
For your convenience, the egalite project provides
a fork of QXmpp that you can install as a shared library.

After installing QXmpp, build ealite as usual, assuming you
have the Prerequisites (see below):

$ cd /where/you/unpacked/egalite
$ ./configure
$ make

This will put an excutable in the bin/ directory.
You can run this as bin/egalite
Or you can do

# make install

and egalite will be installed in your /usr/local/bin, or /usr/bin,
or whatever you specified as prefix in the configure command.


== Prerequisites ==

You need:

g++ (that's gcc/c++)
Qt4.7.1 devel or later
  - this includes qmake and lrelease
QCA2-devel
QCA-ossl  (don't need devel of this)

the exact naming of these may vary depending on your system.
