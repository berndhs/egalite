Dchat / Egalite
===============

direct chat using qxmpp

This is an almost server-less chat.

Chats are done over ssl sockets directly between two peers.
Servers can be used for discovery to establish the direct ssl socket.


== Build and Install ==

To build Egalite, you must first install QXmpp.
For your convenience, the egalite project provides
a fork of QXmpp that you can install as a shared library.

After installing QXmpp, build ealite as usual:

$ cd /where/you/unpacked/egalite
$ ./configure
$ make

This will put an excutable in the bin/ directory.
You can run this as bin/egalite
Or you can do

# make install

and egalite will be installed in your /usr/local/bin, or /usr/bin,
or whatever you specified as prefix in the configure command.
