Egalite Manual
==============

*Egalite* is a instant messenger program.

== Configuration ==

=== Icons ===
Egalite provides a number of standard icons for things like the status of
contacts, making it easier to see if they are online, away, don't want to be
disturbed or similar things.

You can replace these standard icons with icons on your own system. To do this,
you can edit the *icondir* and *iconsize* items in the *style* section of
the configuration.

To find an icon corresponding to the state of a contact, the icon file needs
to have a standardized name. These are the names used by Egalite:

.Status Icon File Names
----
user-away-extended.png
user-away.png
user-busy.png
user-invisible.png
user-offline.png
user-online.png
----
[NOTE]
=========================
Icons are typically scaled to fit into the space given by their
surroundings. Therefore, changing your icons to a different size may not
have the effect you anticipate. Icons with more bits are not always displayed
bigger.
