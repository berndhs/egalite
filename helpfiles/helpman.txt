Egalite Manual

*Egalite* is a instant messenger program.

It provides server-based chat and presence for XMPP compatible servers, such as jabber and google talk, and many others.

*Egalite* also provides direct chat over SSL sockets without server interaction.

== Server (Xmpp) Chat ==

For server chat, the people you chat with are identified by their user name on a server, and the server name. For example, alice.smith@gmail.com or bobjones@jabber.org.

== Direct Chat ==

For direct chat, the people you chat with are identified by an SSL certificate. Since there is no server, there are no user names and server names.

=== Certificates ===

Egalite requires that the end points of a direct chat present SSL certificates.
These certificates can be read from files, or pasted. In either case, they must
be in PEM format.

You can make your own SSL certificates with many available tools. 
Some examples are

* Openssl (http://openssl.org)
* TinyCA or tinyca2 (http://tinyca.sm-zone.net)
* qcatool2 (http://delta.affinix.com/qca)

== Configuration ==

=== Icons ===
Egalite provides a number of standard icons for things like the status of
contacts, making it easier to see if they are online, away, don't want to be
disturbed or similar things.

You can replace these standard icons with icons on your own system. To do this,
you can edit the *icondir* and *iconsize* items in the *style* section of
the configuration.

To find an icon corresponding to the state of a contact, the icon file needs
to have a standardized name. These are the names used by Egalite:

.Status Icon File Names
----
user-away-extended.png
user-away.png
user-busy.png
user-invisible.png
user-offline.png
user-online.png
----
[NOTE]
=========================
Icons are typically scaled to fit into the space given by their
surroundings. Therefore, changing your icons to a different size may not
have the effect you anticipate. Icons with more bits are not always displayed
bigger.
