*Egalite* is a instant messenger program.

It provides <<XMPP,server-based chat>> and presence for XMPP compatible servers, 
such as jabber and google talk, and many others.

*Egalite* also provides <<Direct,direct chat>> over SSL sockets without server interaction.

Finally, *Egalite* provides simple <<IRC,IRC>>.

There is an IRC channel where you can talk about *Egalite*, named _#egalite_ on
the server _chat.freenode.net_.

== [[XMPP]] Server (Xmpp) Chat ==

For server chat, the people you chat with are identified by their user name 
on a server, and the server name. 
For example, alice.smith@gmail.com or bobjones@jabber.org.
To manage these accounts, open the *Identities* menu and select *Server Accounts*.

== [[Direct]] Direct Chat ==

=== Definitions ===

For direct chat, the end points of a chat are specified by *identity* and 
*address*. 

An *itentity* corresponds to a person, and is verified by an SSL certificate.

An *address* corresponds to a communication port on a computer or other
communications device, such as a phone, netbook or tablet.

In order to be connected to incoming chat from other people, your Egalite 
must *listen* for incoming connections. To do this, you need to start a 
listener.

A *listener* is a pair of *address* and *identity*. The address specifies 
where to reach you for direct chat, and the identity specifies who you are for 
purposes of this address.


=== Starting a Direct Connection ===

To start a direct connection with another Egalite user, you need two things:

* Your *identity* with an SSL certificate. You have to make or import the 
identity before you can make a direct connetion. If you don't have an identity,
use the menu item *Identities->Create Certificate*.
* The other user's IP address, as a literal numerical address, or as a URL
that *your* system can resolve. This is called a *direct contact*. You can 
choose from your list of direct contacts (*Contacts->Direct*), or you can 
enter the information when starting the connection.

=== Accepting Direct Connections ===

For other users to connect with Egalite on your computer/device, 
a *listener* has
to be active. For this purpose, you need to have an *identity*, which is a SSL
certificate. You can create one with *Itentities->Create Certificate* and 
use it later.

To start listening for incoming direct connections, use *File->Add Listener*. 
This
will start a dialog which allows you to select an identity (which you created
earlier), and then a address to listen on.

The listener address is one that your computer/device makes visible 
to the outside
world. The _outside world_ here can be the entire internet, or a local network
that your computer is visible on. See *Obtaining Listener Addresses* below for 
more.

As usual, you can enter the address as a numerical IP address, or as a URL.

=== Obtaining Listener Addresses ===

To accept direct connection to your computer/device from outside you local
network, you need an address that is visible to the rest of the world, and
that will accept connections. The listener acts like a server for these
connections.

Many ISPs restrict small customers behind NAT from accepting any such
connections, others require special configuration. There are many ways
of accepting incoming connections on an external IP address.

One way is to acquire an IPv6 address. This is very convenient, and in the
reasonably near future most businesses will have to deal with IPv6 for reasons
completely unrelated to chat applications.

Some ISPs provide IPv6 addresses to their customers. This is the best way
if it is available to you. If not, IPv6 addresses are available for free 
from _tunnel brokers_. Which service is best for you depends 
on your geographic location. You can check this web page
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_IPv6_tunnel_brokers,
and services like http://www.sixxs.net[SixXS],
http://www.he.net[Hurricane Electric], 
http://gogonet.gogo6.com[Gogo6/Freenet6]. Check your ISP
and the internet for your local availability.

=== Mixing IPv6 and IPv4 ===

Egalite can listen to, as well as connect to, IPv6 and IPv4 addresses. With
separate listeners, some can listen on IPv4 while others listen on IPv5.

Of course both ends of any particular connection have to use the same protocol.


=== Certificates ===

Egalite requires that the end points of a direct chat present SSL certificates.
These certificates can be generated by Egalite, or read from PEM format 
files, or pasted in PEM format.

Egalite allows you to create self-signed certificates for the purpose 
of direct chat using the menu item *Itentities->Create Certificate*.

=== Direct Addresses ===

When connecting a direct chat, you need to specify the *address* that the remote 
end of the chat will be at. 

These addresses are stored as *direct contacts*. 

You can specify the address as an IP numberical address (IPv4 or IPv6), or as 
a host name for the DNS service your computer (or device) uses.

== [[IRC]] IRC ==

*Egalite* allows connecting to multiple channels on multiple IRC servers at the
same time.

=== Nicks ===

IRC identities are called "Nicks". You can manage them in *Egalite* by selecting
the *Identities* menu and then *IRC Nicks*.

=== Channel List ===

At the top of the (docked) IRC channel display is a list of channels which you 
are connected to. Click on a channel name to raise the history display for that channel
to the top, and to send input to that channel.

Channels with activity (someone send a message to the channel) are highlighted
in the list.

=== Channel Label ===

The Channel Label acts as a multi-function button:

- *Click* to open or close a context menu
- *Double-Click* to stop/start the drag/flickable behaviour of the history
- *Press-and-Hold* to expand/contract the topic text

=== Channel History ===

The channel history display usually scrolls, and you can drag the content
and flick it (version 0.5 and later). 

To select and copy text from teh history, it can be helpful to stop the
drag/flickable behaviour by *Double Clicking* on the channel name label. 
To re-enable the behaviour double click again.

=== Channel Topic ===

Some channels keep the topic text short and to the point, while other channels do
not. To expand the topic text, *Press-and-Hold* the channel title box.



== Configuration ==

=== Icons ===
Egalite provides a number of standard icons for things like the status of
contacts, making it easier to see if they are online, away, don't want to be
disturbed or similar things.

You can replace these standard icons with icons on your own system. To do this,
you can edit the *icondir* and *iconsize* items in the *style* section of
the configuration.

To find an icon corresponding to the state of a contact, the icon file needs
to have a standardized name. These are the names used by Egalite:

.Status Icon File Names
----
user-away-extended.png
user-away.png
user-busy.png
user-invisible.png
user-offline.png
user-online.png
----
[NOTE]
=========================
Icons are typically scaled to fit into the space given by their
surroundings. Therefore, changing your icons to a different size may not
have the effect you anticipate. Icons with more bits are not always displayed
bigger.
