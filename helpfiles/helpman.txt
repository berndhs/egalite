Egalite Manual

*Egalite* is a instant messenger program.

It provides server-based chat and presence for XMPP compatible servers, such as jabber and google talk, and many others.

*Egalite* also provides direct chat over SSL sockets without server interaction.

== Server (Xmpp) Chat ==

For server chat, the people you chat with are identified by their user name on a server, and the server name. For example, alice.smith@gmail.com or bobjones@jabber.org.

== Direct Chat ==

=== Definitions ===

For direct chat, the end points of a chat are specified by *identity* and 
*address*. 

An *itentity* corresponds to a person, and is verified by an SSL certificate.

An *address* corresponds to a communication port on a computer or other
communications device, such as a phone, netbook or tablet.

In order to be connected to incoming chat from other people, your Egalite 
must *listen* for incoming connections. To do this, you need to start a listener.

A *listener* is a pair of *address* and *identity*. The address specifies 
where to reach you for direct chat, and the identity specifies who you are for 
purposes of this address.


=== Starting a Direct Connection ===

To start a direct connection with another Egalite user, you need two things:

* Your *identity* with an SSL certificate. You have to make or import the 
identity before you can make a direct connetion. If you don't have an identity,
use the menu item *Identities->Create Certificate*.
* The other user's IP address, as a literal numerical address, or as a URL
that *your* system can resolve. This is called a *direct contact*. You can 
choose from your list of direct contacts (*Contacts->Direct*), or you can enter the information when starting the connection.

=== Accepting Direct Connections ===

For other users to connect with Egalite on your computer/device, a *listener* has
to be active. For this purpose, you need to have an *identity*, which is a SSL
certificate. You can create one with *Itentities->Create Certificate* and 
use it later.

To start listening for incoming direct connections, use *File->Add Listener*. This
will start a dialog which allows you to select an identity (which you created
earlier), and then a address to listen on.

The listener address is one that your computer/device makes visible to the outside
world. The _outside world_ here can be the entire internet, or a local network
that your computer is visible on.

As usual, you can enter the address as a numerical IP address, or as a URL.



=== Certificates ===

Egalite requires that the end points of a direct chat present SSL certificates.
These certificates can be generated by Egalite, or read from PEM format files, or pasted in PEM format.

Egalite allows you to create self-signed certificates for the purpose 
of direct chat using the menu item *Itentities->Create Certificate*.

=== Direct Addresses ===

When connecting a direct chat, you need to specify the *address* that the remote 
end of the chat will be at. 

These addresses are stored as *direct contacts*. 

You can specify the address as an IP numberical address (IPv4 or IPv6), or as 
a host name for the DNS service your computer (or device) uses.

== Configuration ==

=== Icons ===
Egalite provides a number of standard icons for things like the status of
contacts, making it easier to see if they are online, away, don't want to be
disturbed or similar things.

You can replace these standard icons with icons on your own system. To do this,
you can edit the *icondir* and *iconsize* items in the *style* section of
the configuration.

To find an icon corresponding to the state of a contact, the icon file needs
to have a standardized name. These are the names used by Egalite:

.Status Icon File Names
----
user-away-extended.png
user-away.png
user-busy.png
user-invisible.png
user-offline.png
user-online.png
----
[NOTE]
=========================
Icons are typically scaled to fit into the space given by their
surroundings. Therefore, changing your icons to a different size may not
have the effect you anticipate. Icons with more bits are not always displayed
bigger.
